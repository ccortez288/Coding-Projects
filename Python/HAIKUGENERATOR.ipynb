Your program should first request that the user provide a topic to begin the Haiku generation. Then, your program should connect to the Datamuse API to find related words that satisfy the requirements of a Haiku (described below). Print your completed Haiku for the user to enjoy. Finally, your program should allow the user to generate as many Haikus as desired.For the purposes of this assignment, the requirements of Haikus are:\n",
