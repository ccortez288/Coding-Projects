Assignment Information: Assignment #1, Hex/Binary Dump Program

Filename: README.txt

File manifest: README.txt, dbx.cpp, dbx.h, makefile, binaryDump.cpp, hexDump.cpp

Compile instructions: Type make to compile the program

Operating instructions: Type dbx filename in the command line to call and execute the hexDump // Type dbx -b filename to give a binary flag and execute the binaryDump. 

List/description of novel/significant design decisions: I wrote it all up and decided to split it into different files for readability purposes. Having them separated made it a little easier for me to manage and test independently from each other. 

List/description of any extra features/algorithms/functionality you included which were not required: Nothing much outside of the features it should've had. The one thing I added in my binaryDump file was a function to convert numbers to binary. 

List/description of all known deficiencies or bugs: 

Lessons Learned: Getting more experience with using C++. Getting a better understanding of how hex and binary dump work. Using makefiles to compile a program on edoras.
