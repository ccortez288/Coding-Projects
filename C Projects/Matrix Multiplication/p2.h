/* This function reads m, n, and p from the datafile.
    It then allocates the correct amount of memory required for matrices
    A, B, and C.
    Then matrices A and B are filled from the datafile.
    The values for m, n, and p are passed by reference, and are
    thus filled in by this function
    PARAMETERS in order are:
