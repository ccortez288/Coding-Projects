In this folder I have a project that I did for a class in Scheme using the DrRacket IDE. 
THe problem prompt is to create these recursive functions:
    - odds:  produces a list consisting of elements in odd positions in the list, that is, the first, third, fifth, seventh, etc.
    - evenrev:  produces a reversed list consisting of elements in even positions in the list, for example, the sixth, fourth, second.
    - penultimate:  produces a list (not an atom) containing the second-to-the-last element in a list
    - palindrome:  a boolean function that determines whether elements in the list consist of a palindrome.
